  <h1>Constant-Denominator Slice Experiment: Operator-Linear Morph</h1>

  <p>
    This page records a numerical experiment inside a particular region of the
    Graph Reals \( \mathbb{R}_G \): the <em>constant-denominator slice</em>.
    The goal is to see how classical network statistics behave along an
    operator-linear geodesic there, and to clarify exactly what kind of
    morphing this tests.
  </p>

  <h2>1. The Constant-Denominator Slice of \( \mathbb{R}_G \)</h2>

  <p>
    The Graph Reals are built as the completion of the field of graph rationals
    \( \mathcal{Q}_G \) under the Graph&ndash;Field Metric, defined via the
    scaled operator&ndash;pair embedding
    \[
      G(q) = \bigl(\Psi(q),\, f(\|\Psi(q)\|)\,\Psi(q)^{-1}\bigr),
    \]
    with product norm
    \(\|(A,B)\|_\times = \|A\|_{\mathrm{op}} + \|B\|_{\mathrm{op}}\).
  </p>

  <div class="definition">
    <strong>Constant-denominator slice.</strong>
    <p>
      The constant-denominator slice is the subset
      \[
        S := \{\,x/1 \in \mathcal{Q}_G : x \in \mathcal{Z}_G\,\}
      \subset \mathbb{R}_G.
      \]
      Under the operator embedding, this maps to pairs
      \[
        G(x/1) = \bigl(\Psi(x/1),\, f(\|\Psi(x/1)\|)\,\Psi(x/1)^{-1}\bigr),
      \]
      and in the operator&ndash;pair completion it appears as
      \[
        S \;\cong\; \{ (\Psi(x), \Psi(1)) : x \in \mathcal{Z}_G \},
      \]
      a linear subspace with a fixed second coordinate.
    </p>
  </div>

  <p>
    On this slice, each element corresponds to a graph-generated operator
    \( T_x \) (or its limit) sitting on a uniform denominator background.
    Step-kernels from finite graphs embed densely into this region, and their
    associated graphons live inside the usual cut-metric space.
  </p>

  <div class="remark">
    <strong>Why this slice is the right setting here.</strong>
    <p>
      The experiment concerns:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>eigenvalues of a normalized adjacency operator \(T\),</li>
      <li>triangle counts, clustering, and path lengths of sampled graphs,</li>
      <li>and distances computed from interpolation \(T_t = (1-t)T_0 + tT_1\).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      All of these are observables of the operator component \( \Psi(x/1) \)
      and the graphs it generates on a fixed vertex space. They do not require
      changes in the denominator geometry, so restricting to the constant
      denominator slice isolates exactly the operator&ndash;level geometry that
      drives these quantities.
    </p>
  </div>

  <h2>2. Geodesics in the Constant-Denominator Slice</h2>

  <p>
    The image of \( S \) under the scaled operator&ndash;pair embedding lies
    inside the Banach space \( \mathcal{B}(H)\times\mathcal{B}(H) \). The
    distance between two points is
    \[
      d_{\mathrm{GF}}(q,r)
        = \bigl\|G(q) - G(r)\bigr\|_\times.
    \]
    In any normed linear space, straight segments are constant-speed geodesics:
    for
    \[
      Z(t) = (1-t)Z_0 + t Z_1,
    \]
    one has
    \[
      \|Z(t) - Z_0\|_\times = t\,\|Z_1 - Z_0\|_\times,
      \qquad
      \|Z(t) - Z_1\|_\times = (1-t)\,\|Z_1 - Z_0\|_\times.
    \]
  </p>

  <div class="theorem">
    <strong>Geodesics with fixed denominator.</strong>
    <p>
      Inside the constant-denominator slice, the image of \( S \) is a linear
      subspace of \( \mathcal{B}(H)\times\mathcal{B}(H) \). For any two points
      represented by operators \(T_0,T_1\) on the same Hilbert space, the path
      \[
        T_t = (1-t)T_0 + t T_1
      \]
      corresponds to a straight segment in the ambient space and therefore
      realizes a constant-speed geodesic between the two endpoints within
      this slice.
    </p>
  </div>

  <p>
    The experiment uses this geodesic structure as the definition of an
    <em>optimal morph</em> between two graphs whose denominators (support
    and measure) remain fixed.
  </p>

  <h2>3. Setup of the Numerical Experiment</h2>

  <p>
    Two graphs on \( n = 100 \) vertices are chosen:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>\(G_0\): a \(10 \times 10\) grid (large diameter, very few triangles),</li>
    <li>\(G_1\): a two-block stochastic block model (short diameter, high clustering).</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Each is mapped to a symmetric normalized adjacency operator
    \[
      T_i = D_i^{-1/2} A_i D_i^{-1/2}, \quad i=0,1,
    \]
    a finite-dimensional version of the graphon operator \(T_{U_i}\). The
    operator-linear morph is then
    \[
      T_t = (1-t) T_0 + t T_1,\quad t \in [0,1].
    \]
  </p>

  <p>
    For each \( t \), two things are done:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>spectral data of \( T_t \) are computed (top eigenvalues),</li>
    <li>a simple graph is sampled from a rescaled version of \( T_t \) and
        classical statistics (triangles, clustering, path length) are measured.</li>
  </ul>

  <div class="remark">
    <strong>What this test is actually checking.</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>That the operator-linear path is behaving as a genuine geodesic
          between \(T_0\) and \(T_1\) inside the constant-denominator slice
          (distance to each endpoint varies linearly along the path).</li>
      <li>How classical network statistics respond along such a geodesic:
          whether they change smoothly, exhibit sharp transitions, or show
          structure reminiscent of phase changes.</li>
      <li>How much of the complexity of “network morphing” is already present
          in the numerator/operator layer, before any denominator or ghost
          geometry is introduced.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <h2>4. Results</h2>

  <h3>4.1 Spectral Behaviour</h3>

  <figure>
    <img src="fig1.png" alt="Top-k eigenvalues along operator-linear morph">
    <figcaption>
      Figure 1: Top \(k\) eigenvalues of \( T_t \) as a function of \( t \).
      The leading eigenvalue stays near \(1\); the others dip and then rise
      again as the morph moves from grid to SBM.
    </figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>
    The leading eigenvalue sits close to \(1\), as expected for a symmetric
    normalized adjacency with a dominant stationary mode. The remaining
    eigenvalues vary smoothly with \(t\) and many follow a U-shaped curve:
    they decrease from the grid endpoint, reach a minimum in the interior,
    and then increase again near the SBM endpoint. This behaviour matches
    the picture of a straight operator path inside the constant-denominator
    slice: the path is geometrically simple in the Graph&ndash;Field metric,
    yet passes through an intermediate regime with weaker coherent structure.
  </p>

  <h3>4.2 Triangles and Clustering</h3>

  <figure>
    <img src="fig2.png" alt="Triangle count and clustering along morph">
    <figcaption>
      Figure 2: Triangle counts (top) and average clustering (bottom) for
      graphs sampled from \( T_t \).
    </figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>
    Near \(t=0\), the grid has essentially no triangles and very low clustering.
    Both statistics remain small for much of the morph, then mount sharply as
    \(t\) approaches the SBM endpoint. The underlying path in operator space
    is linear, yet motif counts respond in a strongly curved way.
  </p>

  <p>
    This highlights a key phenomenon:
    the Graph&ndash;Field geodesic in the constant-denominator slice is
    spectrally smooth, while classical combinatorial statistics register
    something much closer to a transition from “lattice-like” to
    “community-rich” behaviour.
  </p>

  <h3>4.3 Average Path Length</h3>

  <figure>
    <img src="fig3.png" alt="Average shortest path along morph">
    <figcaption>
      Figure 3: Average shortest path length on the largest connected component
      of sampled graphs along the morph.
    </figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>
    The average shortest path length starts around \(8.5\) on the grid and
    decreases steadily toward about \(2.4\) for the SBM. There is mild sampling
    noise, but the overall trend moves smoothly downward as the morph progresses.
  </p>

  <p>
    In geometric terms, the morph collapses a long-diameter lattice into a
    dense, clustered graph along a constant-speed path in the
    Graph&ndash;Field geometry. At intermediate times one already sees much
    shorter paths but still modest clustering, reminiscent of small-world
    effects where distances shrink before clustering fully appears.
  </p>

  <h3>4.4 Distances to Endpoints</h3>

  <figure>
    <img src="fig4.png" alt="Frobenius distances to endpoints along morph">
    <figcaption>
      Figure 4: Frobenius distances \( \|T_t - T_0\|_F \) and
      \( \|T_t - T_1\|_F \) as functions of \( t \).
    </figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>
    The curves \( \|T_t - T_0\|_F \) and \( \|T_t - T_1\|_F \) appear as clean
    straight lines crossing at \( t \approx 0.5 \). Algebraically,
    \[
      T_t - T_0 = t (T_1 - T_0), \qquad
      T_t - T_1 = (t-1)(T_1 - T_0),
    \]
    so
    \[
      \|T_t - T_0\|_F = t\,\|T_1 - T_0\|_F,\qquad
      \|T_t - T_1\|_F = (1-t)\,\|T_1 - T_0\|_F.
    \]
    This is the numerical signature of a constant-speed geodesic segment in
    the ambient norm.
  </p>

  <div class="remark">
    <strong>Relation to the Graph–Field Metric.</strong>
    <p>
      The plots use the Frobenius norm for convenience, while the
      Graph&ndash;Field Metric employs the operator norm in the product space.
      Straight segments enjoy the same linearity property in either normed
      setting:
      \(\|Z(t)-Z_0\| = t\|Z_1-Z_0\|\), so this experiment gives direct
      evidence that the operator-linear path behaves as a genuine geodesic
      between \(T_0\) and \(T_1\) in the constant-denominator slice.
    </p>
  </div>

  <h2>5. What We Learn From This Slice</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>
      With denominator fixed, the operator-linear morph \(T_t\) is a clean
      model of an <em>optimal morph</em> between graphs on a common support
      in the Graph&ndash;Field geometry.
    </li>
    <li>
      Classical observables along this geodesic (spectra, triangles,
      clustering, path length) show structured behaviour: smooth spectral
      evolution, sharply increasing clustering, and steadily shrinking
      average distances.
    </li>
    <li>
      The experiment isolates the contribution of the numerator/operator
      structure, creating a baseline before introducing denominator
      geometry and ghost directions. Any additional complexity observed
      when those are allowed to vary can be understood relative to this
      flat, constant-denominator starting point.
    </li>
  </ul>
