  <h1>Ghost Dark Energy from Pregeometric Ghost Edges</h1>

  <p>
    This page sketches a minimal cosmological model in which late–time cosmic acceleration
    arises from <em>ghost edges</em>, relational degrees of freedom in a graph-valued
    pregeometric algebra (Graph Reals). Ordinary geometry corresponds to the image of an
    operator map \( T \), while ghost edges live in \( \ker T \) and represent pure relations
    without geometric location. Coarse-graining the ghost sector yields a homogeneous
    fluid with an equation-of-state parameter \( w_g \), producing a <strong>ghost dark energy</strong>
    component in a flat FRW universe.
  </p>

  <h2>1. Toy Algebra and Ghost Edges</h2>

  <p>
    We work in a simple real vector space
    \[
      \mathcal{A}_{\text{toy}} = \mathrm{span}_\mathbb{R}\{ K_1,\, \mathbb{I}_\circ,\, \mathbb{E}_\varnothing \},
    \]
    where:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      \( K_1 \): a single-vertex graph (one “unit” of location).
    </li>
    <li>
      \( \mathbb{I}_\circ \): a “unit cycle” element (one vertex, one edge, zero net tension).
    </li>
    <li>
      \( \mathbb{E}_\varnothing \): the <em>ghost edge</em>, defined by
      \[
        \mathbb{E}_\varnothing = \mathbb{I}_\circ - K_1.
      \]
      It has one unit of relation, zero vertices, and sits in the kernel of the operator map.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    A linear operator map \( T \) sends these generators to bounded operators (or scalars in the toy reduction),
    \[
      T(K_1) = 1, \quad T(\mathbb{I}_\circ) = 1, \quad T(\mathbb{E}_\varnothing) = 0,
    \]
    so \( \mathbb{E}_\varnothing \in \ker T \).
  </p>

  <p>
    Any element of the toy algebra can be written as
    \[
      H_{\text{toy}} = \alpha K_1 + \beta \mathbb{I}_\circ + \gamma \mathbb{E}_\varnothing.
    \]
    The coefficient \( \alpha + \beta \) controls the “visible” geometric contribution through \( T(H_{\text{toy}}) \),
    while \( \gamma \) measures the <em>ghost content</em>, invisible to \( T \) but available to other observables.
  </p>

  <div class="definition">
    <strong>Definition (Ghost Edge Content).</strong>
    For a large pregeometric configuration modeled in Graph Reals, the <em>ghost edge content</em> is the
    effective coefficient \( \gamma \) of the ghost edge basis element \( \mathbb{E}_\varnothing \) in the
    corresponding toy reduction. This content lives in the kernel of the operator map and represents pure
    relation without geometric localization.
  </div>

  <h2>2. Coarse-Graining to a Cosmic Ghost Fluid</h2>

  <p>
    Consider a huge comoving region in the universe and average the ghost coefficient over that region:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      Let \( \bar{\gamma}(t) \) denote the coarse-grained ghost edge content per unit comoving volume
      at cosmological time \( t \).
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    We define the <em>ghost energy density</em> by
    \[
      \rho_g(t) = \Lambda_g \, \bar{\gamma}(t),
    \]
    where \( \Lambda_g \) is a constant with dimensions of energy density, encoding the conversion from
    microscopic ghost content to macroscopic energy.
  </p>

  <p>
    At homogeneous background level, \( \bar{\gamma}(t) \) depends only on \( t \), so the ghost sector behaves
    as a spatially uniform fluid. To obtain the simplest working theory, we assign a constant equation of state
  </p>

  <p>
    \[
      p_g = w_g\, \rho_g,
    \]
    where \( w_g \) is an effective macroscopic parameter describing how ghost energy responds to expansion.
  </p>

  <h2>3. FRW Cosmology with Ghost Dark Energy</h2>

  <p>
    In a spatially flat FRW universe with scale factor \( a(t) \), the total energy density includes radiation,
    matter, and the ghost component:
    \[
      \rho_{\text{tot}}(t) = \rho_r(t) + \rho_m(t) + \rho_g(t).
    \]
  </p>

  <p>
    Energy conservation for the ghost fluid is
    \[
      \frac{d\rho_g}{dt} + 3H(1 + w_g)\rho_g = 0,
    \]
    where \( H = \dot{a}/a \) is the Hubble parameter. For constant \( w_g \), this integrates to
    \[
      \rho_g(a) = \rho_{g0}\, a^{-3(1 + w_g)},
    \]
    with \( \rho_{g0} \) the present-day ghost energy density.
  </p>

  <p>
    Introducing the usual density parameters
    \[
      \Omega_i = \frac{\rho_{i0}}{\rho_{\text{crit},0}}, \quad
      \rho_{\text{crit},0} = \frac{3H_0^2}{8\pi G},
    \]
    and assuming exact spatial flatness,
    \[
      \Omega_r + \Omega_m + \Omega_g = 1,
    \]
    the Friedmann equation becomes
    \[
      \frac{H^2(a)}{H_0^2} =
        \Omega_r a^{-4} +
        \Omega_m a^{-3} +
        \Omega_g a^{-3(1 + w_g)}.
    \]
  </p>

  <p>
    In terms of redshift \( z \) with \( a = 1/(1+z) \), this is
    \[
      \frac{H^2(z)}{H_0^2} =
        \Omega_r (1+z)^4 +
        \Omega_m (1+z)^3 +
        \Omega_g (1+z)^{3(1 + w_g)}.
    \]
  </p>

  <p>
    At background level this matches the standard constant-\( w \) dark energy form. The novelty lies in the
    pregeometric interpretation of \( \Omega_g \) and \( w_g \).
  </p>

  <h2>4. Interpretation of \(\Omega_g\) and \(w_g\)</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Ghost density fraction.</strong>
      The parameter \( \Omega_g \) is the present-day fractional ghost energy density,
      \[
        \Omega_g = \frac{\rho_{g0}}{\rho_{\text{crit},0}}
        = \frac{\Lambda_g \bar{\gamma}_0}{\rho_{\text{crit},0}}.
      \]
      It measures how much ghost edge content the universe currently carries when viewed through the
      Graph Reals framework.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Ghost equation of state.</strong>
      The parameter \( w_g \) encodes the macroscopic response of the ghost sector to expansion:
      <ul>
        <li>\( w_g \approx -1 \): ghost content per physical volume remains roughly steady, mimicking a cosmological constant.</li>
        <li>\( w_g &gt; -1 \): ghost energy dilutes faster; ghost edges gradually lose macroscopic influence.</li>
        <li>\( w_g &lt; -1 \): ghost energy grows relative to comoving volume, potentially leading to a phantom-like future.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    In a fuller Graph Reals model, \( w_g \) would be derived from the dynamics of ghost edges:
    how \( \bar{\gamma} \) changes when volumes rescale, and how interactions in the kernel sector
    redistribute ghost content. The constant-\( w_g \) case here serves as a minimal testing
    parameterization.
  </p>

  <h2>5. Phenomenology and Outlook</h2>

  <p>
    At the level of homogeneous cosmology, the model predicts:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      A modified Hubble history \( H(z) \) determined by \( (\Omega_g, w_g) \) and the usual radiation
      and matter densities.
    </li>
    <li>
      Corresponding changes to luminosity distances for supernovae and angular-diameter distances for BAO and CMB.
    </li>
    <li>
      A distinct cosmic age and deceleration history depending on the sign and magnitude of \( 1 + w_g \).
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Observational constraints on \( \Omega_g \) and \( w_g \) thus translate into bounds on the amount and
    behavior of ghost edge content in the underlying pregeometry. Deviations from \( w_g = -1 \) can be read
    as evidence for nontrivial ghost dynamics, such as phase transitions, condensation, or coupling between
    the kernel and image sectors of Graph Reals.
  </p>

  <p>
    Extensions of this working theory include:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      Allowing a time-dependent \( w_g(z) \) tied to specific ghost-edge processes (e.g. geometrogenesis).
    </li>
    <li>
      Studying perturbations in the ghost sector and their impact on the growth of large-scale structure.
    </li>
    <li>
      Relating ghost dark energy more explicitly to the graph-based operator completion and the structure of
      \( \ker T \) in the full Graph Reals framework.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Even in this stripped-down form, ghost dark energy provides a concrete bridge between graph-based
    pregeometry and cosmological data: a way to interpret the dark sector as the large-scale shadow of
    relational degrees of freedom that ordinary geometric operators fail to see.
