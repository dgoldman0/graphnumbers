  <h1>From Clique to Clouds: A High-Level Overview</h1>

  <p>
    This page summarizes a unified algebraic–analytic framework that extends finite graph arithmetic into a continuous limit structure via graphons and operator theory. The central goal is to build a field-like object from finite graphs and embed it into a space of operators that connects naturally with analytic graph limit theory.
  </p>

  <h2>1. Combinatorial-Algebraic Layers</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Graph Naturals</strong> \( \mathcal{N}_G \): Isomorphism classes of finite simple graphs under disjoint union \( \sqcup \) and Cartesian product \( \Box \), forming a commutative semiring.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Graph Integers</strong> \( \mathcal{Z}_G \): The Grothendieck group completion of \( (\mathcal{N}_G, \sqcup) \), forming a commutative ring using formal differences \( [G] - [H] \).
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Graph Rationals</strong> \( \mathcal{Q}_G \): Field of fractions of \( \mathcal{Z}_G \), denoted as \( x/y \).
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2. Operator–Kernel Embedding</h2>
  <p>
    Each graph or formal difference maps to a regularized integral operator:
    \[
      T_x = T_{W_{G_x}} - T_{W_{H_x}}.
    \]
  </p>
  <p>
    Concretely, if the raw step-kernel is
    \[
      W_G^0(x,y)
      = \sum_{i,j=1}^n A_G(i,j)\,\mathbf1_{I_i}(x)\,\mathbf1_{I_j}(y),
    \]
    we choose
      \(\displaystyle \lambda_G > -\min \operatorname{spec}(A_G)\)
    and set
    \[
      W_G(x,y)
      = W_G^0(x,y)
      \;+\;\lambda_G\sum_{i=1}^n\mathbf1_{I_i\times I_i}(x,y).
    \]
    This “loop shift” \(+\lambda_G\delta_{ij}\) guarantees
    \(A_G + \lambda_GI\) has no negative eigenvalues, so the integral operator
    \(T_{W_G}\) is strictly positive and admits a bounded inverse in the polar decomposition.
  </p>
  <p>
    The operator embedding for a rational element \( x/y \) is defined as:
    \[
      \Psi\left(\frac{x}{y}\right) = |T_y|^{-1/2} \, U_y^* \, T_x \, U_y \, |T_y|^{-1/2},
    \]
    where \( T_y = U_y |T_y| \) is the polar decomposition.
  </p>

  <h2>3. Graphons and the Cut-Metric Closure</h2>
  <p>
    The graphon space \( \mathcal{W} \) consists of symmetric measurable functions \( W: [0,1]^2 \to [0,1] \) under measure-preserving relabeling. With the cut-metric
    \[
      d_\square(U, V) = \sup_{S, T} \left| \int_{S \times T} (U - V) \right|,
    \]
    the space \( (\mathcal{W}, d_\square) \) is complete.
  </p>
  <p>
    The closure \( \mathcal{F}_G = \overline{\Psi(\mathcal{Q}_G)} \subset \mathcal{W} \) is a commutative \( \mathbb{R} \)-algebra of graphons. However, it is not a field—division is not continuous in \( d_\square \).
  </p>

  <h2>4. The Operator–Pair Metric and Topological Field Completion</h2>
  <p>
    To recover field structure, we define:
    \[
      E\left(\frac{x}{y}\right) := (\Psi(x/y), \Psi(y/x)),
    \]
    with a metric on pairs:
    \[
      d_{\text{pair}}\big((A, B), (A', B')\big) := \|A - A'\|_{\text{op}} + \|B - B'\|_{\text{op}}.
    \]
    This makes \( E(\mathcal{Q}_G) \) into a topological field where inversion is just coordinate swapping. The completion \( \widehat{\mathcal{Q}_G} \) remains a field.
  </p>

  <h2>5. The Graphon Subring and Compatibility</h2>
  <p>
    The constant-denominator slice \( S = \{ (\Psi(x), \Psi(1)) \} \) forms a subring of the field. Algebraically, this is isomorphic to the original graphon algebra, though the metrics differ.
  </p>
  <p>
    Moreover, the operator–pair metric dominates the cut-metric:
    \[
      d_\square(U, V) \le \|T_U - T_V\|_{\text{op}} \le d_{\text{pair}}((T_U, I), (T_V, I)),
    \]
    which allows the transfer of continuity and density results back to \( d_\square \).
  </p>

  <h2>6. Real Line and Spectral Interpretation</h2>
  <p>
    The embedding \( r \mapsto \kappa_r \) is isometric under both metrics, with \( d = |r - s| \). On this slice, operator-norm and cut-norm coincide.
  </p>
  <p>
    In the full field, \( d_{\text{pair}} \) captures global spectral deviation—differences in principal eigenvalues, walk counts, and other structural graph features. It acts as a spectral extension of classical graph properties to formal graph fractions.
  </p>
<h2>7. Draft Status and Open Issues</h2>
<p>
  This framework remains a <strong>work in progress</strong>. While the algebraic and analytic constructions appear consistent and promising, significant open issues remain in formally verifying that all operations are well-defined and compatible at each stage and in general, this work is an early brainstorm, and not a final result. Proofs are rough and need to be thoroughly verified by additional parties. These gaps are structural and technical, not merely cosmetic. The theory presented should be viewed as a plausible extension awaiting further foundational work.
