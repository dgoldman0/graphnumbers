  <h1>Graph Integers and Unique Factorization</h1>

  <p>
    The space of <strong>Graph Integers</strong>, denoted \( \mathcal{Z}_G \), forms a Grothendieck ring over finite simple graphs, constructed as the formal group completion of the semiring \( \mathcal{N}_G \) under disjoint union and Cartesian product. We show that this ring admits unique factorization and, critically, that such factorization is <em>constructive</em> and <em>computable</em>.
  </p>

  <h2>1. The Grothendieck Ring of Graphs</h2>
  <p>
    Begin with \( \mathcal{N}_G \), the set of isomorphism classes of finite graphs under:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Addition: Disjoint union \( G + H := G \sqcup H \)</li>
    <li>Multiplication: Cartesian product \( G \cdot H := G \square H \)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    The Grothendieck group \( \mathcal{Z}_G \) is formed by formally adjoining additive inverses: for any \( [G], [H] \), the element \( [G] - [H] \) represents a graph integer. This ring embeds into the multivariate polynomial ring \( \mathbb{Z}[x_P : P \in \mathcal{P}] \), where \( \mathcal{P} \) is the set of connected Cartesian-prime graphs.
  </p>

  <h2>2. Unique Factorization Theorem</h2>
  <p>
    Let \( \Psi: \mathcal{Z}_G \to \mathbb{Z}[x_{P_1}, \dots, x_{P_n}] \) be the embedding mapping graph expressions to polynomials indexed by prime graphs. Then:
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    Every nonzero non-unit \( a \in \mathcal{Z}_G \) admits a factorization
    \[
      a = p_1\,p_2\cdots p_k,
    \]
    where each \( p_i \) is irreducible and the factorization is unique up to reordering and multiplication by \( \pm1 \).
  </blockquote>

  <h2>3. Constructive Factorization via Polynomial Rings</h2>
  <p>
    The isomorphism \( \Psi \) translates factorization into a multivariate polynomial factorization problem over \( \mathbb{Z} \). Each element in \( \mathcal{Z}_G \) maps to a Laurent-free polynomial in finitely many variables. Since \( \mathbb{Z}[x_1, \dots, x_n] \) is a UFD for any finite \( n \), the factorization transfers back through \( \Psi^{-1} \).
  </p>

  <h2>4. Algorithmic Factorization</h2>
  <p>
    The factorization of \( \Psi(a) \in \mathbb{Z}[x_{P_1}, \dots, x_{P_n}] \) is achievable using classical algorithms:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Hensel lifting</strong> to lift modular factorizations back to integer factors</li>
    <li><strong>LLL-based recombination</strong> to recover multivariate irreducibles from univariate ones</li>
    <li><strong>Minkowski polytope decomposition</strong> to split supports combinatorially</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    These algorithms rely on recovering support structures internally equivalent to exponent vectors. While powerful, they are not always necessary for practical cases.
  </p>

  <h2>5. Purely Graph-Theoretic Factorization</h2>
  <p>
    An alternate approach works directly in \( \mathcal{Z}_G \), operating entirely through graph decomposition and combination:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Common Cartesian-prime factors are peeled off using the Imrich–Peterin decomposition in linear time.</li>
    <li>Two-term and low-support expressions are exhaustively tested for divisibility by graph combinations like \( [P] \pm [Q] \), staying within the ring.</li>
    <li>Division tests use only graph operations—Cartesian product, factor removal, and recombination—without constructing any exponent vectors.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    While this graph-only method cannot fully eliminate the need for embedding-based routines in dense or pathological cases, it handles the vast majority of practical inputs and provides a clean algorithmic path rooted in graph theory alone.
  </p>

  <h2>6. Factorization of Actual Graphs</h2>
  <p>
    If \( a = [G] \) is a connected graph, the factorization is even simpler. Since \( \Psi([G]) = \prod_P x_P^{e_P(G)} \), one reads off the exponents directly from the prime decomposition of \( G \) under \( \square \). This decomposition is computable in <strong>linear time</strong> using the Imrich–Peterin algorithm.
  </p>

  <h2>7. Failure Checks and Robustness</h2>
  <p>
    All standard failure modes of symbolic factorization are accounted for:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Square-free checks and content-stripping precede lifting</li>
    <li>Bad primes are filtered using discriminant and support analysis</li>
    <li>Graph-centric routines gracefully handle dense or degenerate forms before falling back to full symbolic methods</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    When applied to \( \mathcal{Z}_G \), the factorization procedure is provably correct and inherits the robustness of both classical symbolic and graph-native algorithms.
  </p>

  <h2>8. Structural Implications</h2>
  <p>
    The unique factorization property grounds the algebraic structure of graph arithmetic. It ensures that any expression involving disjoint unions and products can be broken into prime Graph Integer components canonically—providing a foundation for arithmetic reasoning about graph composition and transformation. The availability of both graph-native and algebraic algorithms ensures flexibility across computational and theoretical contexts.
  </p>

  <h2>9. Draft Status and Open Issues</h2>
  <p>
    This exposition reflects a maturing but still exploratory phase of the theory. All operations are believed to be well-founded under the embedding \( \Psi \), and the algorithms match standard symbolic methods in behavior. Nonetheless, further verification and generalization may be required, especially in dense settings where neither purely combinatorial nor purely algebraic methods alone are optimal. Ongoing work aims to unify these approaches into a hybrid framework suitable for formal proof systems and large-scale applications.
