  <h2>A. Graph Limits and Operator Kernels</h2>

  <h3>A.1 László Lovász – <em>Large Networks and Graph Limits</em></h3>

  <p><strong>Summary.</strong><br/>
    Lovász develops the modern theory of graph limits for dense graphs, introducing
    graphons as measurable symmetric kernels \(W(x,y)\) that encode homomorphism
    densities and provide continuum representatives of large graphs. The monograph
    systematizes the connection between graphs, graphons, and integral operators on
    \(L^2([0,1])\), and it establishes convergence notions such as the cut metric.
  </p>

  <p><strong>Relation to Graph Reals and Ghost Edges.</strong><br/>
    The Graph Reals construction uses a similar passage from finite graphs to kernel
    operators, with Graph Reals realized as elements in a completed operator space.
    Ghost edges then live in the kernel of an operator map on that space. Lovász’s
    framework provides the standard vocabulary for graphon-based representations, and
    supports the claim that the operator embedding is a natural extension of known
    graph-limit techniques.

  <h2>B. Graph-Based Emergent Geometry and Pregeometry</h2>

  <h3>B.1 Konopka, Markopoulou, Severini – “Quantum Graphity: A Model of Emergent Locality”</h3>

  <p><strong>Summary.</strong><br/>
    Quantum Graphity models space as a dynamical graph on a fixed set of nodes, with
    edges as quantum degrees of freedom. At high energy the graph is nearly complete;
    as the system cools, a sparse, approximately local graph emerges, potentially
    recovering low-dimensional geometry and locality from an initially permutation-
    invariant state.
  </p>

  <p><strong>Relation to Graph Reals and Ghost Tracking Cosmology.</strong><br/>
    Both Quantum Graphity and Graph Reals treat graphs as the microscopic carriers of
    pregeometric information. Quantum Graphity focuses on a Hamiltonian acting on
    finite graphs; Graph Reals extends graph combinatorics to a completed field-like
    structure of graph-valued elements with an operator embedding. The ghost-edge
    sector, interpreted as “relation without location,” can be viewed as a continuum
    analogue of high-connectivity, nonlocal phases in graphity-type models.

  <h3>B.2 Wilkinson &amp; Greentree – “Energetics of the Quantum Graphity Universe”</h3>

  <p><strong>Summary.</strong><br/>
    This paper analyzes the energy landscape of quantum graphity models as the graph
    evolves from highly connected, “pregeometric” configurations toward low-energy
    graphs resembling extended spatial geometries. The authors study how the number
    of edges and connectivity patterns change and discuss implications for cosmology,
    including expansion-like behavior.
  </p>

  <p><strong>Relation to Graph Reals and Ghost Tracking Cosmology.</strong><br/>
    Wilkinson and Greentree offer a concrete example of taking a graph-based
    pregeometry and seeking cosmological behavior. The ghost tracking cosmology built
    from Graph Reals does something similar at the level of an effective continuum
    model: ghost edges provide a pregeometric reservoir whose coarse-grained density
    appears as a cosmological component that tracks matter at early times and
    mimics dark energy at late times.

  <!-- C. Discrete spacetime and foundations -->

  <h2>C. Discrete Spacetime and Relational Foundations</h2>

  <h3>C.1 Sumati Surya – “The Causal Set Approach to Quantum Gravity”</h3>

  <p><strong>Summary.</strong><br/>
    This Living Reviews article surveys causal set theory, where spacetime is modeled
    as a locally finite partially ordered set whose order encodes causal relations and
    whose counting measure encodes volume. The review covers classical dynamics,
    quantum aspects, cosmological applications, and phenomenology, including ideas
    related to the cosmological constant.
  </p>

  <p><strong>Relation to Graph Reals and Ghost Edges.</strong><br/>
    Causal sets and Graph Reals share the core stance that relational data are
    fundamental and manifold geometry is emergent. Causal sets encode order; Graph
    Reals encode weighted adjacency operators and ghost relations in the kernel of a
    map. Surya’s review places the Graph Reals proposal alongside other discrete,
    relation-first quantum gravity programs and highlights how small combinatorial
    fluctuations can have cosmological significance.

  <h3>C.2 Carlo Rovelli – “Relational Quantum Mechanics”</h3>

  <p><strong>Summary.</strong><br/>
    Rovelli proposes a relational formulation of quantum mechanics where the quantum
    state is always relative to an interaction between systems and physical
    quantities are fundamentally about relations rather than intrinsic properties.
    The paper derives key aspects of the standard formalism from relational
    information-theoretic postulates.
  </p>

  <p><strong>Relation to Graph Reals and Ghost Edges.</strong><br/>
    Graph Reals treat edges (and ghost edges) as primitive relational objects, with
    observable operators summarizing relational structure in the large. Rovelli’s
    work provides a conceptual setting for this approach: it shows how a relational
    ontology fits comfortably within quantum theory and supports interpreting ghost
    edges as relational degrees of freedom rather than hidden local fields.

  <!-- D. Observational cosmology -->

  <h2>D. Observational Cosmology Anchors</h2>

  <h3>D.1 Planck Collaboration – “Planck 2018 Results. VI. Cosmological Parameters”</h3>

  <p><strong>Summary.</strong><br/>
    The Planck 2018 cosmological parameters paper provides high-precision constraints
    on the six-parameter \(\Lambda\)CDM model and several simple extensions, using
    CMB temperature, polarization, and lensing data combined with external datasets.
    It yields benchmark values for \(\Omega_m\), \(\Omega_\Lambda\), \(H_0\), and
    tight bounds on deviations from \(w=-1\).
  </p>

  <p><strong>Relation to Ghost Tracking Cosmology.</strong><br/>
    Planck serves as the primary observational reference against which the ghost
    tracking cosmology must be compared. The ghost sector parameters
    \((\Omega_g, f_{\text{trk}}, w_{g,\infty})\) are designed to reproduce a viable
    background expansion consistent with Planck-level constraints while providing a
    different microphysical origin for effective dark energy via ghost edges in Graph
    Reals.

  <!-- E. Tracking quintessence -->

  <h2>E. Tracking Quintessence and the Coincidence Problem</h2>

  <h3>E.1 Zlatev, Wang, Steinhardt – “Quintessence, Cosmic Coincidence, and the Cosmological Constant”</h3>

  <p><strong>Summary.</strong><br/>
    This paper introduces tracker quintessence models in which a scalar field
    evolves along attractor solutions that cause its energy density to track the
    dominant background component (radiation or matter) over a wide range of
    initial conditions. The tracking behavior is used to address the cosmic
    coincidence problem and to generate late-time acceleration without severe
    fine-tuning.
  </p>

  <p><strong>Relation to Ghost Tracking Cosmology.</strong><br/>
    The ghost tracking model echoes the same intuition in a different microscopic
    setting: ghost edge energy tracks matter at early times and then deviates toward
    dark-energy–like behavior at late times. Instead of a scalar field with a chosen
    potential, the mechanism comes from a simple evolution law for ghost content in
    the Graph Reals kernel sector.

  <h3>E.2 Steinhardt, Wang, Zlatev – “Cosmological Tracking Solutions”</h3>

  <p><strong>Summary.</strong><br/>
    This follow-up paper analyzes tracking solutions in detail, deriving conditions
    on scalar potentials for which attractor behavior occurs and exploring the
    resulting relations between dark-energy equation-of-state, matter density, and
    expansion history. It clarifies how tracking models can naturally delay dark
    energy domination until recent cosmological times.
  </p>

  <p><strong>Relation to Ghost Tracking Cosmology.</strong><br/>
    The ghost tracking evolution law
    \(\rho_g(a) = \rho_{g0}[f_{\text{trk}} a^{-3} + (1-f_{\text{trk}})a^{-B}]\)
    produces behavior conceptually similar to scalar tracking solutions, but with
    parameters that stem from ghost-edge dynamics rather than from a specific
    quintessence potential. Steinhardt et al. thus provide the phenomenological
    target that the ghost-based mechanism aims to match.

  <!-- F. Early dark energy -->

  <h2>F. Early Dark Energy and the Hubble Tension</h2>

  <h3>F.1 Poulin, Smith, Karwal, Kamionkowski – “Early Dark Energy Can Resolve the Hubble Tension”</h3>

  <p><strong>Summary.</strong><br/>
    This work proposes early dark energy (EDE) models where a dark-energy-like
    component becomes significant around recombination and then dilutes rapidly.
    The additional early energy shrinks the sound horizon, allowing higher values of
    \(H_0\) inferred from CMB data and easing the tension with local measurements.
  </p>

  <p><strong>Relation to Ghost Tracking Cosmology.</strong><br/>
    Ghost-based cosmology can produce EDE-like behavior if the ghost sector undergoes
    a graph-dynamical transition near recombination, temporarily enhancing
    \(\rho_g(a)\). Poulin et al. provide a phenomenological template and constraints
    on such early components; the Graph Reals framework offers a pregeometric
    micro-origin for EDE-like terms through ghost edges rather than scalar fields.

  <!-- G. Running vacuum -->

  <h2>G. Running Vacuum and Curvature-Tied Dark Energy</h2>

  <h3>G.1 Lima, Basilakos, Solà – “Thermodynamical Aspects of Running Vacuum Models”</h3>

  <p><strong>Summary.</strong><br/>
    This paper studies cosmological models in which the vacuum energy density
    \(\rho_\Lambda\) depends on the Hubble rate, \(\rho_\Lambda(H)\), motivated by
    renormalization-group arguments in curved spacetime. It analyzes energy exchange
    between vacuum and matter, thermodynamical consistency, and consequences for
    cosmic expansion and structure formation.
  </p>

  <p><strong>Relation to Ghost Edge Cosmology.</strong><br/>
    When ghost edge content is allowed to depend on global geometric quantities
    such as \(H\), the effective ghost energy resembles a running vacuum. Lima
    et al. provide the theoretical and observational framework for models where
    dark energy scales with curvature; Graph Reals adds a specific microscopic
    interpretation in terms of graph-based relational degrees of freedom.

  <h3>G.2 Joan Solà Peracaula – “The Cosmological Constant Problem and Running Vacuum in the Expanding Universe”</h3>

  <p><strong>Summary.</strong><br/>
    Solà’s review discusses the cosmological constant problem and surveys models in
    which vacuum energy evolves with cosmic expansion, often parametrized as a
    function of \(H\) and its derivatives. The review compares these running vacuum
    models with data and emphasizes how they can mimic dynamical dark energy without
    invoking additional scalar fields.
  </p>

  <p><strong>Relation to Ghost Reals and Ghost Edges.</strong><br/>
    The ghost sector in Graph Reals can act as a “running vacuum” whose energy
    content changes with the expansion due to underlying graph dynamics. Solà’s
    review supplies both the motivation and the observational yardstick for such
    behavior, while the Graph Reals framework proposes a discrete relational
    microstructure that could realize it.

  <h2>H. Closing Remarks</h2>

  <p>
    Together, these references show that the Graph Reals / ghost-edge / ghost tracking
    cosmology proposal sits at the intersection of several mature lines of research:
    graphon-based graph limits and operator methods, relational and discrete
    pregeometric approaches to spacetime, and structured dynamical dark-energy and
    running-vacuum models. The unique contribution of the present framework is to
    treat graph-completed relational degrees of freedom—and in particular the ghost
    sector in the kernel of an operator map—as the microphysical origin of a
    phenomenologically viable dark component with a constrained evolution law,
    rather than introducing each cosmological feature separately.
